## Installation

There are pre-built wheels on PyPI for Python 3.10 to 3.13 for Linux, Windows
and MacOS. Any other Python version is not officially supported.

```bash
pip install icspacket
```

Alternatively, to build from source, Python development headers, CMake, Ninja
and a compatible compiler must be installed (preferably GCC, MSVC and clang work
too).

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/MatrixEditor/icspacket
```
